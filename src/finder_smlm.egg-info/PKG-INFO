# FINDER

-----------
by Andreas Nold and Pietro Verzelli


`FINDER` is a (meta)-clustering algorithm developed for Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM).
It was introduced in our paper 
['Unbiased choice of global clustering parameters for single-molecule localization microscopy'](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-27074-1).

For some examples of its usage and all the code used to generate the experiments of the paper, you can refer to 
[this repo](https://github.com/NoldAndreas/FINDER).

# Installation

----------------

The simplest way to install Spektral is from PyPi:
```shell
pip install finder_smlm 
```

To install FINDER on Google Colab:

```python
! pip install finder_smlm
```

## Using FINDER

---------------

Using `FINDER` is really simple.
Here we provide a minimal working example in which we cluster some randomly generated data.

```python
from finder import Finder
import numpy as np

XC = np.random.rand(100, 2) # generate random data to cluster

FD = Finder() # define the model
labels = FD.fit(XC) # fit the data, returning the labels
result = FD.selected_parameters 
print(result)
```

to your code, analogous to DBSCAN in the `sklearn.cluster` package.
FINDER will choose global clustering parameters according to the overall noise levels / the robustness detected in the dataset.
